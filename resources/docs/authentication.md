# Authenticating requests

This API is authenticated by sending an **`Authorization`** header in the form **`"Basic {credentials}"`**. The value of `{credentials}` should be your username/id and your password, joined with a colon (:), and then base64-encoded.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by visiting your dashboard and clicking <b>Generate API token</b>.
